# IntegerAccumulator
The user inputs as many negative numbers they'd like in a specified range ( [-88, -55] or [-40, -1]). Once the user inputs a non-negative value, the program then calculates and displays the number of valid entries, the maximum/minimum of the valid numbers, the sum of all the valid numbers, and the rounded average of the valid numbers. Lastly, a parting message is displayed.
